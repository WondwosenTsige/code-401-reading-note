### Machine learning 

Is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

For true machine learning, the computer must be able to learn patterns that it's not explicitly programmed to identify.

Example: The curious child

        A young child is playing at home... And he sees a candle! He cautiously waddles over.

        Out of curiosity, he sticks his hand over the candle flame.
        "Ouch!," he yells, as he yanks his hand back.
        "Hmm... that red and bright thing really hurts!"
        Ooh a candle!
        Ooh a candle!

        Two days later, he's playing in the kitchen... And he sees a stove-top! Again, he cautiously waddles over.

        He's curious again, and he's thinking about sticking his hand over it.
        Suddenly, he notices that it's red and bright!
        "Ahh..." he thinks to himself, "not today!"
        He remembers that red and bright means pain, and he ignores the stove top.

To be clear, it's only machine learning because the child learned patterns from the candle.

    He learned that the pattern of "red and bright means pain."

    On the other hand, if he ignored the stove-top simply because his parents warned him, that'd be "explicit programming" instead of machine learning.

Key Terminology

    Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

    Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

    Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

    Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

    Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

    Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

    Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

For example, let's say you have a dataset of 150 primary school students, and you wish to predict their Height based on their Age, Gender, and Weight...

    You have 150 observations...

    1 target variable (Height)...

    3 features (Age, Gender, Weight)...

    You might then separate your dataset into two subsets:

    Set of 120 used to train several models (training set)

    Set of 30 used to pick the best model (test set)

#### Data wrangling

Broadly speaking, data wrangling is the process of reshaping, aggregating, separating, or otherwise transforming your data from one format to a more useful one.
