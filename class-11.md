## Data Analysis

**NumPy** _is a commonly used Python data analysis package_. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow, and interface with other packages in the Python ecosystem, like scikit-learn, that use NumPy under the hood

 A __2-dimensional array is known as a matrix__, a matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, weâ€™re able to extract an element from a matrix.

 In a NumPy array, *the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis*. So the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis.

We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. If we pass in a list of lists, it will automatically create a NumPy array with the same number of rows and columns
