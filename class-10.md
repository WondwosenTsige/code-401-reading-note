## Stacks and Queues

What is a Stack?

A __stack__ is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack:

    - __Push__: Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed.

    - __Pop__: Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.

    - __Top__: This is the top of the stack.

    - __Peek__: When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.

    - __IsEmpty__: returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
