## Linear Regressions

### What Is Regression?

Regression searches for relationships among variables.

For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their salaries depend on the features, such as experience, level of education, role, city they work in, and so on.

This is a regression problem where data related to each employee represent one observation. The presumption is that the experience, education, role, and city are the independent features, while the salary depends on them.

Generally, in regression analysis, you usually consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. Each observation has two or more features. Following the assumption that (at least) one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.

In other words, **you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.**

The dependent features are called the **dependent variables, outputs, or responses.**

The independent features are called the **independent variables, inputs, or predictors.**

### When Do You Need Regression?

Typically, you need regression to answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other or how several variables are related. For example, you can use it to determine if and to what extent the experience or gender impact salaries.

### Linear regression

Linear regression is a basic and commonly used type of predictive analysis

The overall idea of regression is to examine two things:

    1.  does a set of predictor variables do a good job in predicting an outcome (dependent) variable?

    2. Which variables in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable, and in what way do they–indicated by the magnitude and sign of the beta estimates–impact the outcome variable?

These regression estimates are used to explain the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

*The simplest form of the regression equation with one dependent and one independent variable is defined by the formula y = c + b*x
*where y = estimated dependent variable score, c = constant, b = regression coefficient, and x = score on the independent variable.*

Naming the Variables

There are many names for a regression’s dependent variable. **It may be called an outcome variable, criterion variable, endogenous variable, or regressand.**

**The independent variables can be called exogenous variables, predictor variables, or regressors.**

Three major uses for regression analysis are

    1. determining the strength of predictors, 
    2. forecasting an effect, and 
    3. trend forecasting.
