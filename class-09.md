## Dunder Methods

In Python, special methods called __dunder methods__ are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores.

Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types

To construct objects from a class we need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder:

The “official” string representation of an object is __repr__ dunder. This is how you would make an object of the class. The goal of __repr__ is to be unambiguous.

The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object is the __str__ dunder. This is for the end user.

In order to iterate over our object in python, we need __len__, __getitem__, and __reversed__ dunders
