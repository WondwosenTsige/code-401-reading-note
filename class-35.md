## Read 35: Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

    1. Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
    2. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
    3. Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
    4. Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
