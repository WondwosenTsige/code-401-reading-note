## Pandas

What Is Pandas In Python?

Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.

Pandas makes it simple to do many of the time consuming, repetitive tasks associated with working with data, including:

    Data cleansing
    Data fill
    Data normalization
    Merges and joins
    Data visualization
    Statistical analysis
    Data inspection
    Loading and saving data
    And much more

We import pandas as follows

    In [1]: import numpy as np

    In [2]: import pandas as pd
